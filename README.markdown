# Slack Invitation app

When you administer a free Slack team, you might know this issue: copying and pasting emails to invite new members is quite cumbersome. It would be so much easier, if they could just fill in their email into a form, hit the submit button and receive an invite from Slack automatically... BINGO! That's exactly what this little Ruby / Sinatra app is doing :-)

_Let people invite themselves to your Slack group with this very simple Ruby / Sinatra app_

## Example running on heroku

https://rubywebdev.herokuapp.com/

_(Actually this app is live and used, please do only enter your email address when you really want to join the group of Ruby developers in Barcelona ;-))_

## Setup

If you want to use this app for your own Slack group, you just have to change the contents of `Config.rb` to match your information.
You can get the Slack API key for your group at https://api.slack.com/

## Development

- [ ] Fork and clone the github repository or just run `git clone git@github.com:mediafinger/slack-inviter.git`
- [ ] Check that you have a compatible Ruby version installed. At the moment the `.ruby-version` file sets it to `2.2.3`
- [ ] run `bundle install`
- [ ] no database needed :-)
- [ ] either ensure that in `app.rb` the `DummyInviter` is instantiated - to not send API calls through the real `Inviter` class
- [ ] or config your team variables on .env file (copy it from .env.example)
- [ ] run the server `bundle exec ruby app.rb`
- [ ] open the website at **http://localhost:4567/**

_If you make it look nicer, than pretty-please send me a pull request :-)_

## Testing

Just run `rake test` to run all the tests.

## Deployment

slack-inviter is a simple Ruby app, using a Gemfile which references Sinatra and all other needed gems. No gem has any system dependencies. The app does not need a database. So it should be fairly easy to deploy to any server that is set up for Ruby apps.

I only deployed to heroku. If you want to do so too:
- just follow the steps on https://toolbelt.heroku.com/ and afterwards:
- run `git push heroku master`
- run `heroku config:set SLACK_TEAM_RUBYWEBDEV_API_TOKEN=your-slack-team-api-token` (you might want to rename the ENV variable to match you slack team name)
- run `heroku open`

_Et voila - you should now have a running app!_

## One last thing

If you use the app, please star it on GitHub and/or let me know you are doing it. Don't worry, it is for free, no strings attached.
